For an implicit IngressGroup, the value is <code>namespace/ingressname</code>.</p> <p>When the groupName of an IngressGroup for an Ingress is changed, the Ingress will be moved to a new IngressGroup and be supported by the ALB for the new IngressGroup. If the ALB for the new IngressGroup doesn't exist, a new ALB will be created.</p> <p>If an IngressGroup no longer contains any Ingresses, the ALB for that IngressGroup will be deleted and any deletion protection of that ALB will be ignored.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: my-team.awesome-group\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p><code>alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.order</code> specifies the order across all Ingresses within IngressGroup.</p> <ul> <li>You can explicitly denote the order using a number between -1000 and 1000</li> <li>The smaller the order, the rule will be evaluated first.
